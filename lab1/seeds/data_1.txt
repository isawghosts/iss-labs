I've lived in New York all my life, and I know Central Park like the back of my
hand, because I used to roller-skate there all the time and ride my bike when I was a kid,
but I had the most terrific trouble finding that lagoon that night. I knew right where it
was--it was right near Central Park South and all--but I still couldn't find it. I must've
been drunker than I thought. I kept walking and walking, and it kept getting darker and
darker and spookier and spookier. I didn't see one person the whole time I was in the
park. I'm just as glad. I probably would've jumped about a mile if I had. Then, finally, I
found it. What it was, it was partly frozen and partly not frozen. But I didn't see any
ducks around. I walked all around the whole damn lake--I damn near fell in once, in fact-
-but I didn't see a single duck. I thought maybe if there were any around, they might be
asleep or something near the edge of the water, near the grass and all. That's how I nearly
fell in. But I couldn't find any.
